** Revealing the dynamic of topics on Zen - a public blog platform. **
The project consists of a [Tableau Public dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/praktikum_tableau_project/sheet4?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) revealing the dynamic of events by topics / events by sources within the publications on Zen blog platform depending on time of a day, as well as correspondence of article topics to source topics.
A [pdf file](https://github.com/AnnaSerikova/practikum_projects/blob/main/zen/zen_presentation.pdf) provides a general overview of the topics' dynamic.
