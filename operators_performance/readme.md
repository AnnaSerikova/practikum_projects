# operators_performance
**Defining the call centers’ operators whose performance is below the baseline.**
The project reveals efficiency targets for call centers’ operators and helps to define those operators who do not match ones.

## Key conclusions
1. There are 48 call centers whose operators’ performance is below the baseline.
2. Main efficiency rates are missed / accepted calls relation and response time.

A PDF file provides brief results and general recommendations.
