# workshop_taxi
**Revealing the optimal coverage for a taxi service necessary for balancing demand and supply throughout the day.**
The project shows the time periods during the day when the taxi coverage is critically low and suggests measures for coverage balancing.

## Key conclusions
1. Unfunded revenue could be as much as $3 million.
2. Main coverage lack is observed during morning / evening peak hours jn weekdays and afternoon time on Saturdays.
3. These slotsâ€™ coverage should be prioritized as soon as possible.

A PDF file provides brief results and general recommendations.
