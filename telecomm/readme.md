**Revealing NPS within the telecommunication providerâ€™s clients.**

The project consists of a [Tableau Public dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anna.serikova7712/viz/sumup_project_2_dashboard/NPS_3?publish=yes) revealing the NPS metric in terms of age, lifetime, gender, city of clients.

The data for the project has been provided by a telecommunication services provider and extracted from the database with an SQL request.

## Key conclusions
1. General NPS score is 21.97%.
2. Promoters are mainly old clients from Moscow age  of 35 - 44.
3. Detractors are mainly old clients from Moscow but their age is of 25 - 34.
